Pretty self-explanatory. Contents of repository:

1) fizzbuzz.rb - implements fizzbuzz in ruby

2) fizzbuzz.py - implements fizzbuzz in python (using a generator). Less
                 elegant, but was testing the idea

3) tictactoe.py - simple tic-tac-toe game. Lets you play any size grid (though
                  very large grids will get pretty boring, and will start to
                  look ugly).

4) tictactoe3.py - same as tic-tac-toe, but ported into Python 3. Less
                   extensively tested than tictactoe.py.

5) ttt_design.pdf - scans of design notes for tictactoe.py. Has some of the
                    (not particularly organized) rationale behind its 
                    implementation
